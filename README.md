## Lyrics

```

ya ya ya
out of my leauge
out of my leauge
out of my leauge
(out of my leauge)

out of my leauge brought into light
what do i see when dawn's too bright
bonded with mist sensing the blind
far too elite i can't align

it's the gentle breeze of anointment
furious drizzle from treacherous minds
content commotion i can't pay the obvious
i can't figure out when you tellin me lies

tellin' me lies

it's a disguise forming around the identities
splendid morbidity vibes within my entity
roaming the mind, forging new paths
for eternity dies folded inside my arms 
folded inside my arms
folded inside my arms

coz it's the feeble tease of these moments
dubious presents from murderous kind                            (marvellous kind)
opened for voided that can't tell the difference
i can't sense a thing when you fading the light 
every time i count up to demise
making me die, keeping me faint                                 / keeping my faith
fading the light, dimming the light
making me die 

ya ya ya
out of my leauge
out of my leauge
out of my leauge
(out of my leauge)

out of my leauge brought into light
what do i see when dawn's too bright
bonded with mist sensing the blind
far too elite i can't align

it's the gentle breeze of anointment
furious drizzle from treacherous minds
content commotion i can't pay the obvious
i can't figure out when you tellin me lies

tellin' me lies

it's a disguise forming around the identities
splendid morbidity vibes within my entity
roaming the mind, forging new paths
for eternity dies folded inside my arms 
folded inside my arms
folded inside my arms






----


it's a disguise forming around the identities
splendid morbidity vibes within my entity
roaming the mind, seeking few flaws
for eternity dies folded inside my arms 

pull up your masks of endless layers
thru which i peel
i cannot surmise to 
dare theatre of moods make it surreal 


---

turns into dust and still blows through the winds 
of a fantasy
what you amassed is close to hypocrisy
avast what you make of your moves
is up to your moods

out of my leauge brought into light
what do i see when dawn's way too bright
bonded with mist sensing the blind
far too elite i can't align

it's the gentle breeze of annointment
furious drizzle from treacherous minds
content commotion i can't pay the obvious
i can't figure when you tellin me lies



everytime i count down to demise
worlds inside my skull they agonize
for the loss

still i truly out and tell you
what are the lies
when i tell you the lies
